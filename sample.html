            <h3>Rice</h3>
                <p>
                    Rice is the staple food of people from Southern and eastern parts of India. 
                    It is hence widely cultivated in India and other parts of Asia such as China,
                    Japan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, etc. Globally, China is the leading 
                    producer of rice with India being the next. As per statistics, West Bengal is
                    the leading rice producer in India followed by Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra, 
                    Punjab, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Haryana. Cultivating rice
                    laborious and it needs a lot of water. Therefore, rice cultivation is practiced in those 
                    places wherein the labor cost is less and rainfall is high.

                    <p>
                     <p>Wheat (Triticum spp.) occupies the prime position among the food crops in the world. In India, it is the second important food crop being next to rice and contributes to the total foodgrain production of the country to the extent of about 25%. Wheat has played a very vital role in stabilizing the foodgrain production in the country over the past few years.
                     The origin of the durum wheats was probably in the region of Abyssinia, whereas the whole group of soft wheat, which includes the bread wheats, probably originated in the region of Pakistan, SouthWestern and the Southern parts of mountainous Bokhara.
                    <h4>Classification of Indian Wheats:</h4>
                    <h5 style="margin-left: 35px">1. Emmer Wheat (Triticum dicoccum schub L.) :</h5>
                      <p style="margin-left: 35px">This type was reported to be grown in south i.e. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This type is believed to be developed from T. diccoides koru., a wild form. It is also grown in Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia.</p></br>
                    <h5 style="margin-left: 35px">2. Macroni Wheat ( T.durum Desf.) : </h5>
                      <p style="margin-left: 35px">The durum or macroni wheat, cultivation in India, is considered to be very old. It is a best wheat for drought conditions or under restricted irrigated conditions of Punjab, M.P., Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal and H.P. It is used for semolina (suji) preparation.</p></br>
                    <h5 style="margin-left: 35px"> 3. Common Bread Wheat ( T. vulgare Host) :</h5>
                      <p style="margin-left: 35px">It is a typical wheat of alluvial soils of Indo-Gangetic plains i.e.Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and parts of Rajasthan. The bulk of the Indian crop, therefore, consists of this type.</p></br>
                    <h5 style="margin-left: 35px">4. Indian Dwarf Wheat (T.spherococcum Mihi.) :</h5>
                      <p style="margin-left: 35px">This belongs to the club wheat of western countries. This is found in limited areas of M.P., U.P., of India and in Pakistan. These are characterised by very short and compact heads having a shorter grains.</p></br>
                    <h5 style="margin-left: 35px">5. Triticum aestivum :</h5>
                      <p style="margin-left: 35px"> This is the type presently grown in India in almost all the wheat growing zones. It is used mainly for bread purpose.</p></br>

                <p>

                    Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Pers.), popularly known as jowar, is the most important food and fodder crop of dryland agriculture. The annual area under it ranges between 17 and 18 million hectares and the annual production between 8 and 10 million tonnes.

 

                    Sorghum is originated in India and Africa. It is also said that its origin is Abyssinia and from there it was brought to USA and European countries.

                        

                    Jowar is mainly concentrated in the peninsular and central India. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (the Bundelkhand region) and Tamil Nadu are the major jowar â€“ growing states. Other states grow sorghum in small areas primarily for fodder.

                        

                    The sorghum grain is used primarily as human food in various forms, such as roti or bhakri 

                    (unleavened bread), or is cooked like rice. Sorghums are also malted, popped and several 

                     local preparations are made. Green and dried fodder is the most important roughage for 

                    feeding cattle throughout the country. The utilization of grain sorghum as a cattle feed, 

                    poultry ration and other industrial uses is at present not very significant, although 

                    considerable scope exists.

                    Bajra popularly known as Pearl millet, cattail millet or bulrush belongs to the 

                    raminea. The crop is cultivated for grain as well as for fodder in the arid region of 

                    Africa and Asia and as a pasture in U.S.A. It is originated in India or Africa.

                    It is grown all over India except Assam and part of northeast India.

                    Finger millet, Eleusine coracana L., is also known as African millet, koracan, ragi (India). It is an important staple food in parts of eastern and central Africa and India. It is an important cereal in Karnataka. It is extensively grown in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Gujrat and Maharashtra and in the hilly regions of Uttar Pradesh and himachal Pradesh, with a total area of 2.5 million hectares and 2.2 million tonnes of production.

 

                    The height of cultivars varies from 40 cm to I m and the spike length ranges from 3 to 13 cm. The colour of grains may vary from white through orange-red deep brown and purple, to almost black. The grains are smaller than those of pearl millet, and the mean I 000-seed weight is about 2.6 g.

                <h3>Maize</h3>

                <p>

                        Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most versatile emerging crop shaving wider adaptability under varied agro-climatic conditions. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has the highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. It is cultivated on nearly 150 m ha in about 160 countries having wider diversity of soil, climate, biodiversity and management practices that contributes 36 % (782 m t) in the global grain production. The United States of America (USA) is the largest producer of maize contributes nearly 35% of the total production in the world and maize is the driver of the US economy. The USA has the highest productivity (> 9.6 t ha-1) which is double than the global average (4.92 t ha-1). Whereas, the average productivity in India is2.43 t ha-1. In India, maize is the third most important food crops after rice and wheat. According to advance estimate it is cultivated in 8.7m ha (2010-11) mainly during Kharif season which covers 80% area. Maize in India, contributes nearly 9 % in the national food basket and more than Rs. 100 billion to the agricultural GDP at current prices apart from the generating employment to over 100 million man-days at the farm and downstream agricultural and industrial sectors. In addition to staple food for human being and quality feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw material as an ingredient to thousands of industrial products that includes starch, oil, protein, alcoholic beverages, food sweeteners, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper industries etc.

 

                        Importance:

                        Forage and Feed: The next important field where maize finds extensive use is for livestock feeds viz, cattle Poultry and piggery both in the form of seeds and fodder. The green fodder can be fed to milch cattle to boost the milk production of a considerable extent; Ã¢â‚¬Å“South African MaizeÃ¢â‚¬  is a best suited variety for fodder. The crop has to be harvested when the grains are in milky stage, This variety is supposed to have Lactogenic effect hence especially suited for milch cattle. The digest ability of maize fodder is higher than sorghum, bajra and other non-leguminous forage crops.

                        

                        Food: In most of the developing countries maize is consumed directly as food. In India, over 85 percent of the maize production is used as food. Most commonly used forms are as (1) Chapattis (2) porridges of various forms (iii) boiled or roasted green ears (iv) breakfast foods like corn flakes and (v) Pop corn. For the (iii) and (v) category sweet and Pop corn varieties are especially grown in USA and Europe.

                        

                        Other Uses: The maize cob, the central rachis to which the grains are attached remains as an agricultural waste after threshing; it finds many important agricultural and industrial uses. Approximately it forms 15 to 18% of the total ear weight and contains 35% cellulose, 40% pentose and 15% ligninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Their uses in agriculture includes as a litter for poultry and as a soil conditioner.

                        

                        Industrial Uses: The industrial uses based on the physical properties of the cob when ground to powder are as fillers for explosives in the manufacture of plastics, glues, adhesives, reyon, resin, vinegar and artificial leather and as diluents and carrier in the formulation of insecticides and pesticides. Based on the chemical properties the processed cobs find their use in the manufacture of furfurol, fermentable sugars, solvents, liquid fuels, charcoal gas and other chemicals by destructive distillation, and also in the manufacture of pulp, paper and hard boards.

                    <h3>Land Preparation For few Crops below:</h3>
        
                    <h4>Rice</h4>
        
                    <p>
        
                            Land preparation is important to ensure that the rice field is ready for planting. A well-prepared field controls weeds, recycles plant nutrients, and provides a soft soil mass for transplanting and a suitable soil surface for direct seeding.
        
         
        
                            Land preparation covers a wide range of practices from zero-tillage or minimum tillage which minimizes soil disturbance through to a totally 'puddled' soil which actually destroys soil structure.
        
                            
        
                            It typically involves (1) plowing to "till" or dig-up, mix, and overturn the soil; (2) harrowing to break the soil clods into smaller mass and incorporate plant residue, and (3) leveling the field.
        
                            
        
                            Initial land preparation begins after your last harvest or during fallow period. This is important for effective weed control and for enriching the soil. Generally, it will take 3âˆ’4 weeks to prepare the field before planting.
        
                    </p>
        
                    <h4>Soil for Rice Cultivation</h4>
        
                    <p>
        
                            Almost every type of soil can be used for rice cultivation provided the region 
        
                            has a high level of humidity, sufficient rainfall with irrigational facilities, 
        
                            and a high temperature. The major types of soils for rice cultivation are black 
        
                            soil, red soil (loamy and yellow), laterite soil, red sandy, terai, hill and medium
        
                             to shallow black soil. It can be even cultivated on silts and gravels. 
        
                             If the cultivating soil has rich organic matter and if it powders easily on 
        
                             drying or forms a puddle when wet then it is considered to be ideal.
        
                    </p>
        
                   <h4> pH Level for Rice Farming</h4>
        
                    <p>Rice can be cultivated in both acidic as well as alkaline soil.</p>
        
                   <h4>Wheat</h4>
        
                   <p>
        
                        The wheat crop requires a well-pulverized but compact seed bed for good and uniform 
        
                        germination. Three or four ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy 
        
                        season, followed by three or four cultivations and planking immediately before sowing 
        
                        produce a good, firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils. For the irrigated 
        
                        crop, the land is given a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa or raund) and the number of 
        
                        ploughings is reduced. Where white ants or other pests are a problem, Aldrin 5% or
        
                         BHC 10% dust at the rate of 25 kg/ha should be applied to the soil after the last
        
                          ploughing or before planking.
        
                   </p>
        
                   <h4>Jowar</h4>
        
                   <p>
        
                        Deep summer ploughing with mould board plough soon after rabi crop is harvested and 
        
                        leaving the soil exposed to sun until onset of monsoon is a common practice. 
        
                        With the onset of monsoon the land should be ploughed twice by country plough. 
        
                        But the soil for grain crop should be pulverised for a fine tilth by harrowing and 
        
                        cross plankings. If desired, field should be levelled before sowing so that rainwater
        
                         may be well distributed throughout the field.

                        onset of monsoon the land should be ploughed twice by country plough. But the soil for 
        
                        grain crop should be pulverised for a fine tilth by harrowing and cross plankings.
        
                         If desired, field should be levelled before sowing so that rainwater may be well 
        
                         distributed throughout the field.

                        In areas with a rainfall of 60 to 75 cm, ragi is cultivated as a rainfed crop. 
        
                        So the field should be deeply ploughed for moisture conservation. 
        
                        But in irrigated crop, plough the field immediately at the arrival of monsoon until 
        
                        gets fine tilth.

                        A good seedbed for maize should be fine but compact, and free from weeds. It is desirable that the previous crop refuse is buried under with a mouldboard plough. In due course, two or three ploughings with the wooden plough are given. In case the tractor is used, one ploughing followed by a couple of diskings is generally adequate.
        
         
        
                        For kharif cultivation, it is essential that adequate drainage is provided. 
        
                        It may be provided in the form of very shallow surface drains at 40-50 m apart 
        
                        (depending on the slope and the texture of the soil) across the slope and connected 
        
                        to main outlet. Shallow drains do not obstruct the movement of the cattle or tractors
        
                         during cultivation. Surface drains should be provided during sowing

                            I. Selecting Rice Seed
        
         
        
                            Only the best seed should be selected for planting for the following reasons:
        
                            
        
                            - good seed results in healthier, heavier, and potentially higher-yielding seedlings.
        
                            
        
                            - good seed results in seedlings which recover quickly from transplanting shock.
        
                            
        
                            - good seed results in rapid root growth, enabling seedlings to draw nutrients from the soil quickly and effectively.
        
                            
        
                            - good seed results in uniform germination and growth of seedlings, making it easier for the farmer to time crop management practices (e.g. transplanting, irrigation, fertilization, weeding).
        
                            
        
                            - good seed has a high germination rate, facilitating exact calculation of seed requirements and thus preventing wastage dÂ´," to nursing of too few or too many seedlings.
        
                            
        
                            A good sample of rice seed should be:
        
                            
        
                            - genetically pure (Genetic purity cannot always be determined by visual inspection; the best way to ensure genetic purity is by obtaining seed from a reliable source - e.g. the Ministry of Agriculture, an international agricultural organization - or by encouraging farmers to produce their own seed.)
        
                            
        
                            - dried to less than 14% moisture content (since improperly dried seed often rots during storage.)
        
                            
        
                            - capable of germinating at a rate of at least 80% (since it is usually uneconomical to plant seed if a considerable portion will not germinate.)
        
                            
        
                            - free of weed seeds - free of diseases - free of Pest infestation
        
                            
        
                            - free of inert matter (e.g. chaff, empty grains, grit, broken grains.)
        
                            
        
                            Important: When dealing with seed of unknown origin, always remember that it is often impossible to evaluate a seed sample merely by looking at it. Genetic impurities, improper dryness, disease contamination, and pest infestation often do not manifest themselves until the seed is sown and has started to grow. Be sure to test a small portion of the sample (by actually growing an experimental plot) to ensure that the seed is acceptable. Never commit a farmer to growing seed which may turn out to be of poor quality.

                            Currently, most wheat varieties can be saved by the producer and used the following year for planting. This historical practice is still popular among many wheat producers. In some cases, however, a producer has signed an agreement to not save the seed of a particular variety for planting and this must be honored.
        
         
        
                            Producer-saved seed can be categorized into three categories of non-certified seed:
        
                            
        
                            bin-run seed is the most common and is not cleaned, treated, or tested prior to planting;
        
                            custom-cleaned bin-run seed has been cleaned or conditioned in a way to improve its quality;
        
                            treated custom-cleaned bin-run seed.
        
                            Seed in all of these categories is usually not tested for germination, purity, or weed seed contamination.

                        To get the required plant stand, healthy and good ear-heads with well-filled seeds need to be selected
        
                        at the time of harvesting. Seed from such ear-heads are stored in a well ventilated with low moisture conditions.

                            Seeds are very small (400 seeds / g) and take 5 -7 days to germinate. Hence good seeds, land preparation helps in better germination, minimize weeds problem and effective soil moisture conservation. In Uttaranchal where frequent ploughing oper ations are difficult to carry out effective digging and turning of soil, removing perennial weeds, land smoothening, providing inward slope with a shallow drain helps in taking out excess rain water.
        
                            Prepare a well pulverized seed bed for direct seeding of ragi. Apply FYM or compost 5t/ha and incorporate well into the soil along with fertilizer before sowing. Sow the direct seeded crop in line 22.5 cm apart, seed rate of 10kg/ha will be adequate for line sow crop.

                    <p>
        
                            Most farmers practice nursery bed method. Nursery beds are made occupying about 1/20th of the total field area. The paddy seeds are sown in the bed. They are ready within 25 days of sowing in low land areas while in higher altitudes they take about 55 days to become ready for transplantation. There are four different practices of cultivation of rice, viz. transplantation method, drilling method, broadcast method and Japanese method.
        
                            <h5 >Transplantation</h5> is the most commonly used method wherein seeds are first sown in nursery and the seedlings are transplanted to the main field once they show 3-4 leaves. Although this is the best yielding method, it requires heavy labor.
        
                            <h5 >Drilling method</h5> is exclusive to India. In this method, one person ploughs a hole in the land and the other person sows the seed. Ox is the most commonly used â€˜personâ€™ to plough the land.
        
                            <h5 >Broadcast method</h5> generally involves scattering of the seeds manually over a large area or in the entire field. Labor involved is very less and so is the precision. This method produces very less yield as compared to others.
        
                            <h5 >Japanese method</h5> has been adopted for the high yielding variety of rice and those that need a high amount of fertilizers. Seeds are sown in nursery beds and then transplanted to the main field. It has shown tremendous success for the high yielding varieties.
        
                            Another newly found technique is SRI method of rice cultivation. This is a high yielding method with less water but this method is more laborious.

                            <li>Sowing time:</li>
        
                            Based on above temperature requirement it has been found that for indigenous wheat last week of October, for long duration dwarf varieties like Kalyansona, Arjun, etc. first fortnight of November and for short duration dwarf wheats like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. second fortnight is the best sowing time. Under exceptionally late sown condition it may be delayed to latest by 1st week of December beyond which if area is very small transplanting may be practiced.
        
                            
        
                            <li>Seed rate:</li>
        
                            Generally, a seed rate of 100 kg/ha has been found to be sufficient for most of the varieties like Kalyan Sona, Arjun, Janak, etc.which have moderate tillering and medium sized grains. But a higher seed rate of 125 kg/ha is desirable for late sown wheat and normal sown for varieties like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. which have bold grains and shy tillering habits.
        
                            
        
                            <li>Spacing: :</li>
        
                            For irrigated, timely sown wheat, a row spacing of 15 to 22.5 cm is followed, but 22.5 cm between the rows is considered to be the optimum spacing. Under irrigated late-sown conditions, a row spacing of 15-18 cm is the optimum. For dwarf wheats, the planting depth should be between 5 and 6 cm. Planting beyond this depth results in a poor stand. In the case of conventional tall varieties, the depth of sowing may be 8 or 9 cm.
        
                            
        
                            <li>Seed treatment:</li>
        
                            The seed of loose smut-susceptible varieties should be given solar or hot-water treatment. If the wheat seed is used only for sowing, and not for human consumption or for feeding cattle, it can be treated with Vitavax.

Kharif crop should be sown soon after first break of monsoon rains i.e. nearly in last week of June. Therefore, the best sowing time is in last week of June to first week of July depending upon onset of monsoon. Whereas rabi jawar is sown in the month of October to November.
        
         
        
                            <li>Spacing:</li>A spacing of 40-45 cm between the rows and 15-20 cm between the plants is quite satisfactory.
        
                            
        
                            <li>Seed rate: </li>Required plant population may be obtained by using a seed rate of 8-12 kg/ha. The seeds are sown about 3-4 cm deep in the furrows.

                   <p>
        
                        Sowing time :- Most appropriate time of sowing is middle or last week of July
        
                        Seed rate and Spacing:-
        
                        4-5 kg/ha for drilling method
        
                        2.5-3 kg/ha for dibbling method
        
                        spacing 40 â€“45 cm between rows, 10 â€“15 cm within rows.
        
                        Seed treatment- The organo-mercurial compound Ceresan, Agrosan should be used @ 2.5-3 kg/ha to control seed borne diseases
        
                        
        
                        Generally the crop requires low quantity of nutrients. But All India Co-ordinated Millet Improvement Project has proved that new plant types of bajra especially hybrids respond to very high doses of fertilizers.
        
                        
        
                        Under rainfed areas application of organic manures such as FYM or compost helps in increasing the crop yield at the rate of 150-200 quintals/ha 80 â€“100 kg N:40-50 kgP:40-50kgK is recommended dose for hybrid variety.
        
                        
        
                        Fertilizers are applied in split doses, half of nitrogen, full phosphorus and potash should be basal placed at the time of sowing . The organic manures must be applied 20 days before the sowing of the seeds for full decomposition. One fourth dose of nitrogen should be applied about 30 days and 60 days after sowing.

                        A plant population of 4 to 5 lakhs per ha is optimum for getting higher yields and higher or lower population than the optimum will reduce the yield. There are various methods practiced for ragi cultivation.
        
         
        
                        In rainfed ragi, ragi is grown as intercrop or mixed crop with non cereal crops.
        
                        In irrigated ragi, ragi is grown as sole crop.
        
                        The following methods are used for irrigated and rainfed ragi.

                    <p>
        
                            Direct sowing is the practice of sowing seeds directly in the main field, eliminating the process of seedling raising and transplanting. The seeds are sown in the prepared land before or with the onset of monsoon. The following three methods used for sowing ragi seeds.

                            <li>Sow the seed ensuring full coverage of the site. Mixing the seed with an inert material may help you broadcast the seed by hand</li>
        
                            <li>Seeds should have moisture within 24 hours of sowing.</li>
        
                            <li>Each handful weighs about 10-20 grams so you should cover 7-15 metres per handful</li>

                                    <li>Seeds are sown in the main field in lines.</li>
        
                                    <li>The spacing is 22.5 to 30 cm between lines and 8 to 10cm within a line.</li>
        
                                    <li> The seed should not be sown less than 3-4 cm deep.</li>
        
                                    <li>Line sowing ensures better germination, reduces seed requirement and facilitates intercultural operation as compared to broadcast method of sowing.</li>

                    Transplanting is the practice of raising the seedlings in nursery and transplant.
        
                    <h5>a.Transplating Seedling</h5>
        
                        <ul>
        
                                <li>Irrigate the beds during transplanting and  level the bed if it is not levelled</li>
        
                                <li>3 to 4 weeks seedlings should be transplanted in the field</li>
        
                                <li>Transplant 2 to 3 seedlings per hill in normal planting and 4 to 6 seedlings in delayed planting.</li>
        
                                <li>For early kharif and Rabi season, plant 21 â€“ 25 days old seedlings at a spacing of 25 cm x 10 cm</li>
        
                                <li>For Late Kharif season, plant 25-28 days old seedlings at a spacing of 30 x 10 cm</li>
        
                                <li>Plant the seedlings at a depth of 2 to 3 cm. Deeper planting delays tillering and root regeneration, increases duration and flowering at different times</li>
        
                                <li>Transplant in lines at proper spacing to maintain the correct level of panicles per metre. This also eases subsequent operations. Random planting leads to uneven growth of tillers and reduce panicles per metre.</li>
        
                                <li>Prepare slurry with 5 packets (1000g) per hectare of Azospirillum inoculant in 40 litres of water and dip the root portion of the seedlings in the solution for 15 to 30 minutes and transplant.</li>
        
                                <li>Dip the leafy portion of the seedlings in 0.1% carbendazim solution before planting to arrest the transfer of blast to main field.</li>
        
                                <li>The beds should be irrigated on the third day after transplantation</li>
        
                                <li>Replace the dead hills with new seedlings from the same nursery within one week</li>
        
                        </ul>

                                <li>When planting ragi seedlings beyond 21 days, increase the number of seedlings to 3/hill and increase N level by 25% to minimize yield loss.</li>
        
                                <li>Maintenance of optimum plant population is an important prerequisite for getting higher yield under rainfed conditions. Poor germination, often, is the result of inadequate moisture after sowing in low rainfall areas. Under these conditions, the adoption of a simple technique like seed hardening will not only improve germination and subsequent plant stand but also impact early seedling vigour and tolerance to drought.</li>

                            <li><h5>Selection of seed:</h5> Seed should be free from insect, pest and disease free. It should be free from weed seed. It should be purchased from reliable sources. It should be high germination percentage</li>
        
                            <li><h5>Sowing method: </h5>Maize seed should be sown with dibbling or drilling method. It is depending on purpose of sowing, type of of maize, varieties and farm condition. Seed should not be sown more 5-6 cm depth of soil.
        
         
        
                            <li><h5>Seed rate and plant geometry: </h5>To achieve higher productivity and resource-use efficiencies optimum plant stand is the key factor. The seed rate varies depending on purpose, seed size, plant type, season, sowing methods etc.</li>
